# **Electoral LLM - Empowering Voter Insights with Intelligent Agents.**

We built a multi-agent conversational & simulation framework from scratch. With just 4 lines of code, you can beat Chain-of-Thought prompting by relying on intelligent agents to do all the work for you. 

In Electoral-LLM, we'll be simulating real-time changes in political party popularity based on specific current events. Using our framework, we can mass generate hordes of human-like llms with complete backstories and indentities. 

```python
from Network import Network
breaking_news = '''Breaking News! Donald Trump will launch his own cryptocurrency.'''
agent_network = Network(breaking_news, "Pennsylvania", 15)
agent_network.simulate("round_robin", 1)
```
